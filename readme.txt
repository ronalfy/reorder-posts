A simple and easy way to reorder your custom post types in WordPress.

== Description ==

A simple and easy way to reorder your custom post-type posts in WordPress. Adds drag and drop functionality for post ordering in the WordPress admin panel. Works with custom post-types and regular posts.

We consider Reorder Posts a <strong>developer tool</strong>. If you do not know what `menu_order` or custom queries are, then this plugin is likely not for you.

This plugin was originally developed for <a href="https://metronet.no/">Metronet AS in Norway</a>.

The plugin is now independently developed by <a href="https://geek.hellyer.kiwi/">Ryan Hellyer</a>, <a href="http://www.ronalfy.com">Ronald Huereca</a> and <a href="http://scottbasgaard.com/">Scott Basgaard</a>.

== Installation ==

Either install the plugin via the WordPress admin panel, or ...

1. Upload `metronet-reorder-posts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

For each post type, you will see a new "Reorder" submenu.  Simply navigate to "Reorder" to change the order of your post types. Changes are saved immediately, there is no need to click a save or update button.

By default, ordering is enabled for all post types.  A settings panel is available for determining which post types to enable ordering for.

Advanced customization is allowed via hooks.  See the <a  href="https://github.com/ronalfy/reorder-posts#plugin-filters">Plugin Filters on GitHub</a>.

This tool allows you to easily reorder post types in the back-end of WordPress. How the posts are sorted in the front-end is entirely up to you, as it should be.

We do have advanced settings under `Settings->Reorder Posts`, but these should only be used for testing purposes.

You'll want to make use of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query">WP_Query</a>, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts">get_posts</a>, or <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/pre_get_posts">pre_get_posts</a> to modify query behavior on the front-end of your site.

Examples of each are on the respective pages above.  You are welcome to leave a support request if you need help with a query and we'll do our best to get back with you.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where's the settings page? =

The settings are located under Settings->Reorder Posts.  Settings are optional, of course, as the plugin will work with no configuration.  We consider the settings useful for only advanced users (i.e., users with coding experience).

= Where is the "save" button when re-ordering? =

There isn't one. The changes are saved automatically.

= Do I need to add custom code to get this to work? =

Yes, and no.  There are many ways to retrieve posts using the WordPress API, and if the code has a `menu_order` sort property, the changes should be reflected immediately.

Often, however, there is no `menu_order` argument.  In the plugin's settings, there is an "Advanced" section which will attempt to override the `menu_order` property.  Please use this with caution.

= Can I use this on a single post type? =

You are able to override the post types used via a filter (see below) or navigate to the plugin's settings and enable which post types you would like to use.

`<?php

add_filter( 'metronet_reorder_post_types', 'slug_set_reorder' );
function slug_set_reorder( $post_types ) {
	$post_types = array( 'my_custom_post_type', 'my_other_post_type' );
	return $post_types;
}

?>`

= Does the plugin work with hierarchical post types? =

Yes, but be wary that the plugin now allows you to re-nest hierarchical items easily.

= Does it work in older versions of WordPress? =

This plugin requires WordPress 3.7 or above.  We urge you, however, to always use the latest version of WordPress.

= Does this sort posts within a category (i.e., a term)? =

No, but there is an add-on for this plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/reorder-by-term/">Reorder by Term</a> you should check out.
